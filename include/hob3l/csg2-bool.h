/**
 * Boolean operation on two lazy polygons.
 *
 * This does 'r = r op b'.
 *
 * Only the path information is used, not the triangles.
 *
 * \p r and/or \p b are reused and cleared to construct r.  This may happen
 * immediately or later in cp_csg2_op_reduce().
 *
 * Uses \p tmp for all temporary allocations (but not for constructing r).
 *
 * This uses the algorithm of Martinez, Rueda, Feito (2009), based on a
 * Bentley-Ottmann plain sweep.  The algorithm is modified:
 *
 * (1) The original algorithm (both paper and sample implementation)
 *     does not focus on reassembling into polygons the sequence of edges
 *     the algorithm produces.  This library replaces the polygon
 *     reassembling by an O(n log n) algorithm.
 *
 * (2) The original algorithm's in/out determination strategy is not
 *     extensible to processing multiple polygons in one algorithm run.
 *     It was replaceds by a bitmask xor based algorithm.  This also lifts
 *     the restriction that no self-overlapping polygons may exist.
 *
 * (3) There is handling of corner cases in than what Martinez implemented.
 *     The float business is really tricky...
 *
 * (4) Intersection points are always computed from the original line slope
 *     and offset to avoid adding up rounding errors for edges with many
 *     intersections.
 *
 * (5) Float operations have all been mapped to epsilon aware versions.
 *     (The reference implementation failed on one of my tests because of
 *     using plain floating point '<' comparison.)
 *
 * Runtime: O(k log k),
 * Space: O(k)
 * Where
 *     k = n + m + s,
 *     n = number of edges in r,
 *     m = number of edges in b,
 *     s = number of intersection points.
 *
 * Note: the operation may not actually be performed, but may be delayed until
 * cp_csg2_apply.  The runtimes are given under the assumption that cp_csg2_apply
 * follows.  Best case runtime for delaying the operation is O(1).
