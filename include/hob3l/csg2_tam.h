 * convenience shapes (like rectangles) for anthing that can be
 * reduced to a polygon.  Also, the basic shapes are normalised and
 * have as few parameters as possible.
 *
 * Note: the structure restricts how 'add' can be used: 'cut' and 'sub'
 * must have children of type 'add'.
 *
 * FIXME: We might need more shapes here, i.e., all shapes that can
 * emerge from cutting cylinders, cones, and frustrums with a plane.
 * If not, we'd have to convert them to polygons, which I'd like to
